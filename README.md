# IROC-Drone-Project
Codebase for Anveshak’s Drone Participating in IROC (Held by ISRO). Includes codes on few different Algorithms I used for Safe Landing Spot Detection. 

🧠 Overview
We’re building a fully autonomous drone system capable of completing mission-specific tasks involving:

Flight control and navigation.

Mapping of Arena.

Safe landing zone detection (in progress).

Sensor data processing and decision-making.

Landing on Safe spots.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python, C++ (in backend)

Middleware: ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)

Flight Stack: PX4, MAVROS

Simulation: Gazebo, ArduPilot SITL

Vision: OpenCV, SLAM (planned)

Hardware: Custom drone platform with onboard sensors (IMU, camera, etc.)

🔍 Current Focus
I’m currently working on the safe landing spot detection module, which uses the mapped point-cloud by the depth camera and sensor data to identify and validate safe, obstacle-free zones for autonomous landing.


🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

ROS2

PX4 Autopilot
